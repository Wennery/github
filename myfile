Now I am gonna write the journal of today. For one thing, I felt very depressed. I  am still shy and not very outgoing. Sometimes, I have very very low self-esteem. I don't know what I can do in this competing very. I don't know how to gain all this power to be the perfect me. Maybe I should just let go of my ego, just fit into the class. I really don't know what to say. All the above words are nonsense. Bye! Just have fun during this two years. I don't want you die achieve ing nothing!


When given a choice, choose the thing that scares you a little. If it's 100% safe, it is holding you back.

printf("Hello World");

this is an important moment for me.
